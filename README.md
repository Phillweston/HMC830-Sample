## Overview
The source code of frequency generator of radar UAV project is based on stm32f1 main control chip and compiled with cubemx Hal library. 

The source code can realize frequency sweep transmission and read the signal of specific frequency, and send it to the upper computer through the serial port.

The source code of GPS host computer of the project is in another repository, which has not been completed yet.
